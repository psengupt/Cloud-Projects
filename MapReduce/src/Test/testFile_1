Unlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the procrastination principle (i.e. waiting for an issue to cause enough problems before taking measure to solve it) regarding the security of its content.[21] It started almost entirely open—anyone could create articles, and any Wikipedia article could be edited by any reader, even those who did not have a Wikipedia account. Modifications to all articles would be published immediately. As a result, any article could contain inaccuracies such as errors, ideological biases, and nonsensical or irrelevant text.

Restrictions
Over time, the English Wikipedia and some other Wikipedias gradually restricted modifications. For example, in the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.[22] On the English Wikipedia and some others, some particularly sensitive and/or vandalism-prone pages are now "protected" to some degree.[23] A frequently vandalized article can be semi-protected, meaning that only certain editors are able to modify it.[24] A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only administrators are able to make changes.[25]

In certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors. For example, the German Wikipedia maintains "stable versions" of articles,[26] which have passed certain reviews. Followin
